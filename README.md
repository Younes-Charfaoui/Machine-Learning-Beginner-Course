# Introduction 🎉💯🎓
Machine Learning Beginner course (MLBC) is a course devoted to beginners in the domain of machine learning, this course will reveal the idea behind machine learning and its philosophy, the types, techniques, and tools to know as newcomers. We’ll kick off our Python and machine learning journey with the basic, yet important concepts of machine learning. We will start with what machine learning is about, why we need it. We will then discuss typical machine learning tasks and explore several essential techniques of working with data and working with models. It is a great starting point of the subject and we will learn it in a fun way. At the end of this course a final challenge will have a place to practice what we learned.
